These ROMs are the official factory RC2014 ROMs as supplied with RC2014 products.  Copyright of their respective owners.  Sourcecode, where available, is elsewhere in this Github repo or found with a quick Google search.  See http://rc2014.co.uk/1515/decoding-rom-labels/ for more info.

Every ROM now has an 8 digit code on it.  Each digit, from left to right, refers to an 8k bank from 0x0000 to 0xD000.  This bank can be selected with the A13, A14, A15 jumpers;

Address	A15	A14	A13	ROM Label

0000	0	0	0	 Xooooooo

2000	0	0	1	 oXoooooo

4000	0	1	0	 ooXooooo

6000	0	1	1	 oooXoooo

8000	1	0	0	 ooooXooo

A000	1	0	1	 oooooXoo

C000	1	1	0	 ooooooXo

E000	1	1	1	 oooooooX
 

The value of the digit represents the ROM image that sits in that particular 8k bank.  Currently, it will be one of the following;

0 - Empty bank, available for user to program

R - Microsoft BASIC, for 32k RAM, 68B50 ACIA, with origin 0x0000

K - Microsoft BASIC, for 56k RAM, 68B50 ACIA, with origin 0x0000

1 - CP/M Monitor, for pageable ROM, 64k RAM, 68B50 ACIA, CF Module at 0x10, with origin at 0x0000

2 - Microsoft BASIC, for 32k RAM, SIO/2, with origin 0x0000

4 - Microsoft BASIC, for 56k RAM, SIO/2, with origin 0x0000

6 - CP/M Monitor, for pageable ROM, 64k RAM, SIO/2, CF Module at 0x10, with origin at 0x0000

88 - Small Computer Monitor for pageable ROM, 64k RAM, SIO/2 or 68B50 ACIA, with Microsoft BASIC and CP/M boot options

9 - Small Computer Monitor for any ROM, any RAM, any UART


Note that files with "plus" appended are for the RC2014 Micro Plus and RC2014 Classic II Plus which use a 39SF010 (128k ROM)
